  I worked on a project during the Full Time Data Science and Machine Learning Immersive Bootcamp at [Xccelerate](https://xccelerate.co/en/).
  The project was to create a product recommendation model for an international B2B e-commerce online platform focusing on medical supplies.
  As the non-disclosure agreement (NDA) was signed, specific datasets and model architecture will not be shown.
  This is a project applying similar concept to the fashion industry. 
  I will implement a different algorithm structure to ensure there is no breaches of the NDA.
